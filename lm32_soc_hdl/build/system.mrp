  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.84

Peak Memory Usage:  587 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  15 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   15 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal i2c_sda connected to top level port i2c_sda has been
   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal i2c_scl connected to top level port i2c_scl has been
   removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network lm0/Mram_registers_ren64/SPO has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 127 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   lm0/Mram_registers_ren63/SPO,
   lm0/Mram_registers_ren62/SPO,
   lm0/Mram_registers_ren61/SPO,
   lm0/Mram_registers_ren60/SPO,
   lm0/Mram_registers_ren59/SPO
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   4 block(s) removed
   3 block(s) optimized away
   2 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "i2c_scl" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "i2c_scl_OBUFT" (TRI) removed.
The signal "i2c_sda" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "i2c_sda_OBUFT" (TRI) removed.
Unused block "i2c_scl" (PAD) removed.
Unused block "i2c_sda" (PAD) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
